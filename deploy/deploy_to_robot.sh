# This script copies your entire ANUBIS directory to a remote robot
# over SSH using rsync. It assumes you have SSH access to the robot.
# This means that you do not need to connect the robot to the internet or to a monitor 
# unless you are adding external dependencies. The syncing should handle any amount of changes you may be making
# note that the ANUBIS directory on the robot will be replaced with your local copy.
# and the Anubis Directory on the robot will be located at ~/Deployments/ANUBIS
# The normal Anubis directory will be left alone for any potential edge cases.
