[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findsparkcan.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "sparkcan",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "sparkcan" with any
  of the following names:

    sparkcanConfig.cmake
    sparkcan-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "sparkcan" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "sparkcan_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "sparkcan" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
